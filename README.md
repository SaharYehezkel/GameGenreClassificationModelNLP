## INTRO TO DATA SCIENCE - Final Project
Game's Genre Classification Model Using NLP
by Sahar Yehezkel

This project utilizes the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tackle this challenge. By employing language models and machine learning techniques, 
we aim to develop a genre classification system that can effectively analyze game descriptions or summaries and assign them to the appropriate genres. In addition,
by scraping and crawling we got a lot of data to present in plots and get some information about our data.
